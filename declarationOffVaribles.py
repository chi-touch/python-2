#Write Python code to declare two variables , x and y and assign them the values 10 and 20 respectively. Then display the sum , division, subtration, multiplication and floor division of x and y

x = 10
y= 20
sum =x + y
division =x/y
multiplication = x* y
floor division = x //y

print(sum)
print(division)
print(multiplication)
print(floor division)
